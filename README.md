# Editify
At Editify, we utilize cutting-edge technologies to create a seamless image editing platform. Our project is developed using OpenCV and Flask, both recognized for their efficiency and versatility. OpenCV equips us with a rich library of computer vision and image processing algorithms, enabling advanced editing features like grayscale conversion, edge detection, resizing, and blurring. Flask serves as the backbone, providing a lightweight and flexible framework for building dynamic web services. Together, these technologies form the core of Editify, empowering users to unleash their creativity effortlessly.
